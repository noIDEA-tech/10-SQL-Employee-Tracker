## Features
functionality to manage an employee database via terminal commands to view all employees, employee roles, employee salaries, add/delete employees, update employees; view all roles, add/delete roles, view all departments, add/delete departments.

## Tests
Running the following commands in the terminal root directory: psql -f db/schema.sql; psql -d employee_db -f db/seeds.sql, and node index.js

## Issues
Some of the issues I had building this database include being able to successfully log into PostgreSQL. The issue was that one of the characters in my password was a '#', which my .env file read as a comment and excluded it from the password. This was corrected by quotation marks. Other issues I had were typos and missing sections of code. Overall, it was a great learning experience for understing PostgreSQL and how crucial it is to perform commands in the proper order.
